## Caseconvert

This [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org) module provides quick case conversions for arbitrary text. Supported modes include:

- All lower case
- All upper case
- Capitalized case (adapted from [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20284515/capitalize-first-letter-of-every-word-in-lua))
- URL slug (adapted from [Draco Blue](https://dracoblue.net/dev/convert-titlestring-to-url-slug-in-php-or-lua/))

### Usage

Trigger with hotkey `⌃⌥⌘T`. Once you type or paste text conversions for each supported mode will auto-populate. They can be chosen with `⌘1-4` or by pressing the arrow keys and then Enter. The text will be copied to your clipboard.
